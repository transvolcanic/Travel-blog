The Old Faithful geyser is a must-see for every Yellowstone visitor. It isn't the largest geyser in the world,   
but you can count on Old Faithful erupting approximately every hour and a half. The nearby visitors center   
provides a schedule. View the geyser eruptions from the perimeter or take the mile-long hike to Observation Point   
 where you can see it from above.

Thousands of years of erosion caused by wind, rain and other natural forces have created the expansive  
canyon. It stretches approximately 20 miles long and about half a mile wide. The Yellowston River that  
runs through the canyon is nearly 1,000 fee deep, and earns the title of longest undammed river in the  
country. 

Hike along the various trails in the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone to view the Upper and Lower falls  
from different viewpoints.
