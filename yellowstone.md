The Old Faithful geyser is a must-see for every Yellowstone visitor. It isn't the largest geyser in the world,   
but you can count on Old Faithful erupting approximately every hour and a half. The nearby visitors center   
provides a schedule. View the geyser eruptions from the perimeter or take the mile-long hike to Observation Point   
 where you can see it from above.
